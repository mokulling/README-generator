## Description

This project generates a markdown readme file with a table of contents, description, and contact information for the developer creating it. This project was created using node.js. The project uses Inquirer to prompt the user on the name of their project, what kinds of permissions they want to use, as well as their contact information. The app then generates a new markdown file with a filename equal to the name of the project the user provided.
